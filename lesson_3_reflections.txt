When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

E.g. if I want to collaborate with others, if I want to have an external backup, or if I work from different machines and want to be able to access the repository from anywhere.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Someone else might push into the remote repository and my code might get broken due to this.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork creates a new repository from an existing one. Good if you are not the owner or collaborator of the original repository.
Cloning is useful if a repository exists and I want to contribute to this repository.
A branch is useful within an exisiting repository if I want to test things out, or want to conduct bigger changes within a project before merging it back.
