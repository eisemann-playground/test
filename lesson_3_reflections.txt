When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

E.g. if I want to collaborate with others, if I want to have an external backup, or if I work from different machines and want to be able to access the repository from anywhere.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Someone else might push into the remote repository and my code might get broken due to this.
